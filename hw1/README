First, we sent the Hello message with our NU ID and looped over the status messages.
For each status message, we compute the solution and send it to the server. The loop ends
if we reach a BYE or an unknown message where we either print the flag or raise exception.

We tested the code by testing the flags and tested the solutions to the problems were correct.
We ran on both our NU IDs to make sure we both got secret flags.
